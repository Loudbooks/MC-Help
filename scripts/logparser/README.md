# Log Parser

This script is used to gather log files from Minecraft from various launchers to help troubleshoot crashes and issues. Directories are listed depending on the launcher chosen, and the user is able to decide whether they would like to upload a launcher log or a latest log. No personally identifiable information is uploaded.

All output is uploaded to [PasteBook](https://pastebook.dev), and other users will be able to view these logs at the [PasteBook Panel](https://pastebook.dev/panel).

## Usage (Windows Only)
1. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/Loudbooks/MC-Help/releases/latest/download/logparser.bat).
2. Double click the file.
